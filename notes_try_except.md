# 🧠 Try-Except in Python – CS50P Notes by Anin

## 🔥 Code Breakdown

```python
while True:
    try:
        n = int(input('enter an integer '))
        print(f"you typed {n}")
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("not a valid number")
🎬 The Stage: while True
Think of it as an immortal loop.

Keeps asking for input forever until you explicitly break it.

It’s your program saying: "I won’t stop until you give me a valid number."

🎭 The Actor: try
The risky operation (int(input())) goes here.

If it succeeds, awesome. If not, it throws an error.

try is your safety net for unpredictable inputs.

💣 The Risk: int(input())
input() always gives a string.

int() tries to convert it to a number.

If the user types letters ("hello"), Python throws a ValueError.

🛡️ The Shield: except ValueError
This block catches the ValueError.

Instead of crashing, your code handles it gracefully and tells the user:
"not a valid number"

Then it loops again.

✅ The Break
If the input is a valid integer, the loop breaks:

break
This is the only way out of the loop.

input → try:
           ↓
        valid? -----> YES → print + break → exit
           |
           NO
           ↓
      except → print → loop again
☕ Analogy: Coffee Shop
You run a 24/7 coffee shop.

Customers must order by number (1, 2, etc.)

If someone says "latte" instead of 2, you correct them politely.

You only close the shop when someone finally says a valid number.

try = attempt to understand order

except = handle bad orders

break = close the shop
